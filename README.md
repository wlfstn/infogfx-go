# infogfx-go
Golang image generation library for creating infographics like virtual IDs

## Purpose
The intention for this golang library is for re-usable functions on various project I work on.
Taking the lower-level extended libraries for Go's image and text packages and making a higher level one for generating graphics such as but not limited to:
- Virtual ID (User joins a discord server and the discord bot generates an image graphic)
- Table list
- Pie Chart

## To-Do Features
- Implement a function that outputs a fully generated image from variadic inputs.
- Implement a function that generates infographic table from variadic inputs.
- Implement a function that generates a pie chart from variadic inputs.
- Implement a Go test.
